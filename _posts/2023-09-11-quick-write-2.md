The sounds of rain pounding upon a metal sheet. Thousands of leaves. The wind howling through the branches, the wind chimes. Absolute darkness. Nothing around but trees and fields for miles around, 'cept for one lone house.

A single lit window, a small sign of life. The rustic home battered by the rain and gusts. A truly desolate and harrowing existence.

Inside the house, an old lady. The crackling of a small fire, its warm glow casting light upon her and the room. An old rocking chair creaking, the wood floor and chair sticking slightly as the chair rocks back and forth.

It is a cosy respite.

The fire is starting to smoulder. Around, there is no spare wood. Not a piece of kindling, nor some bundled up paper. As the minutes go by, the warm light diminishes.

The woman smiles, for although she is soon to be fully in darkness, the moment is worth living in. The fulfilled sense of safety. Warmth. Comfort.

Despite the circumstances, this old house has survived the storms before many times.
