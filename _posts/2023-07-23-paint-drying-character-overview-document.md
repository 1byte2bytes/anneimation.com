Recently having come to the Human Realm a couple of months ago, she is still discovering the world, but has some experience now. She is timid and avoids getting into large groups of people. She likes cooking with Camila and reading about the Human Realm.

## Masha

Masha is a human from Gravesfield who is into the supernatural and mythical. They work at the Gravesfield Historical Society documenting the mythical history of the town. Masha is very friendly and welcoming, but tends to have a small social circle due to their weird interests and reclusiveness. They love to read and play electric guitar.
