Suddenly, the room was filled with an enormous amount of energy. An amount of energy only explained by the phrase "like kid in a candy store". In this case, it's a kid in a bake sale, but that's basically the same thing right?

Young Carmen looks around upon the trays of baked goods. Many, many brownies, cookies, bars, bites, cupcakes... so many delicious confections for one's enjoyment.

She goes the aisle, to diligently make sure everything is in its rightful place. Everything is just looking _so_ good... surely nobody would notice if something goes missing...

She backs off from the baked deliciousness.

Even if nobody else would know, she would, and that would make the delicious treats for a "job well done" quite bitter.
