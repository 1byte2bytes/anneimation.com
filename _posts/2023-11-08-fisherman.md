description: A lonely man by the sea.
---

*A small poem-type thing I had the sudden inspiration for:*

On the rocks, a man sits patiently.

Some may describe him lonely.

Ocean breeze, seagulls shrieking. 

His fishing rod cast, waiting for a bite.

Deep blue waves, clear blue sky, a beautiful vista.

He isn't lonely today.

Mother nature by his side.
